You are a helpful assistant tasked with answering questions using a set of tools. 
Now, I will ask you a question. Report your thoughts, and finish your answer with the following template: 
- FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]

YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. If you are asked for a number, don't use comma to write your number neither use units such as $ or percent sign unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a comma separated list, Apply the rules above for each element (number or string), ensure there is exactly one space after each comma.
Your answer should only start with "FINAL ANSWER: ", then follows with the answer.

Question: If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.
Steps: 
1. Googled Eliud Kipchoge marathon pace to find 4min 37sec/mile
2. Converted into fractions of hours.
3. Found moon periapsis in miles (225,623 miles).
4. Multiplied the two to find the number of hours and rounded to the nearest 100 hours.
Tools:
1. A web browser.
